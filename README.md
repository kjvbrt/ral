# ral

Key4hep library for use in ROOT RDataFrame based analysis.

## Build instructions

First, you should source the Key4hep nigthlies stack from CVMFS.
```
source /cvmfs/sw-nightlies.hsf.org/key4hep/setup.sh
```
Then you just need to clone the repository and use cmake for
making the build. In this case, it is also shown how to setup an 
install directory.
```
git clone https://github.com/HEP-FCC/ral.git
cd ral
mkdir build
mkdir install
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build --target install .
```
Library installation folder should be added to the ROOT PATH in order
to be used. In this cases, there is a script in the Key4hep satack that can
be used:
```
k4_local_repo
```

## How to contribute

In order to make contributions to the project, you should work on your own fork of the project. It
is important that you keep yout fork updated with the originial repo. An easy way to do it is configure
a remote with the original repo and rebase often to keep you updated:

```
git remote add official https://github.com/HEP-FCC/ral.git
git fetch official
git rebase -i offcial/main
```

Once your changes are ready and your fork is synced with the original repo, you can 
open a pull request on github to ask for a merge. Don't forget to pass the tests
and format your code with clang-format.

## Add more ral code with metaprograming

Since ral library methods are very similar in structure and they are implemented for different 
EDM4hep classes, a metaprograming package in python has been develop to generate the library
code.

The code generation for a function is based on the FunctionSignature class. It is a template
that has the functionality to print the function in the header and the source files. You should
create a new class for a new family of functions (getters, sorters...) that inherits FunctionSignature and implement the details for that family. Take a look to the FunctionGetter class to see an example.

The function generator class created before is used by the RalClassWriter class to generate the 
header and soruce files. This class store the file name, includes, namespaces and functions that 
should be included in the cpp files and generates them. You should add a method for instanciate in
the functions list the new function generator that you create.

Finnaly, you shoud create a python script for every EDM4hep class that is going to be included in
the library. This script shoud create a method that accept the header and source directories and 
should instanciate a RalClassWriter and specify the EDM4hep class, includes, namespaces and 
methods. Finally, the method should call the RalClassWriter write method to create the code
files.

The method created in the last step should be called from the __main__.py file. This allow the
generation of the code when the package is run as a command line program.

In order to use the package, it should first installed. This can be done in a virtual enviroment 
so that you dont polute the global python installation.

```
python -m venv <path>
source <path>/bin/activate
```

Once the virtual enviroment is sourced, you can install the package in editable mode so that every
change will be directly apply in the installation. 

```
pip -e <main dir of the repo>
```

To use the package to generate the code, you can simply run:

```
python -m metaprograming <headerDir> <srcDir>
```

## Interactive use

In order to use this library inside ROOT REPL one can open a root file with
```
root test.root
```
and then in the ROOT REPL do
```cpp
gSystem->Load("libral.so");
loadRal();
ROOT::RDataFrame dframe(*events);
auto hist = dframe.Define("pT", "k4::ral::ReconstructedParticle::get_pt(ReconstructedParticles)").Histo1D("pT");
hist->Draw();
```

The whole output of the ROOT REPL can be seen here:

## Library tutorial

Ral library is composed by a series of basic analyzers that acts on EDM4hep 
objects to obtain and transform information about them. In this short tutorial
you can see how this library can be used for different purposes.

This tutorial has been designed for analizing simulation results from the 
FCC. Everything is explained as if you would be analyzing a ROOT dataframe (df)
with the events from the simulation. 

### Getters

These kind of methods allow the user to get information about some quantity
for every object in a collection. In this case, if you want to know the 
momentum of a reconstructed particle you could use:

```
auto newDf = df.Define("p", "k4::ral::ReconstructedParticle::getP(ReconstructedParticles));
```

This operation extracts a RVEC with all the momentums in every ReconstructedParticle
collection for each event.

### Printers

Sometimes you will need to see some numbers on the screen to be sure that 
everything is fine. For that reason a series of print methods where develop
next to the getters so they can be use for debugging. 

```
auto newDf = df.Define("p", "k4::ral::ReconstructedParticle::printP(ReconstructedParticles));
newDf.Snapshot("events", "final.root", { "p" });
```

Since Define is lazily evaluated on RDataFrames, it is necessary to do an 
Snapshot in order to see the information printed on the screen

### Maskers

This methods allow to create boolean masks that can be used later to filter
a collection selecting items that meet the condition. For example, if we
want to create a filter for selecting particles with energies greater than 5
GeV and a transverse momentum lower than 3 GeV/c:

```
auto newDf = df.Define("maskE", "k4::ral::ReconstructedParticle::maskE(LogicalOperators::ComparisonOperator::GREATER, 5., ReconstructedParticles))
               .Define("maskPt", "k4::ral::ReconstructedParticle::maskPt(LogicalOperators::ComparisonOperator::LESS, 3., ReconstructedParticles))
               .Define("filteredParticles", "k4::ral::LogicalOperators::filter((maskE && maskPt), ReconstructedParticles));
```

### Selectors

This methods are simple masks that have been used to filter a collection. The 
inputs are the same as in a mask method. Let's select the particles which 
polar angle is greater than 0:


```
auto newDf = df.Define("polarSel", "k4::ral::ReconstructedParticle::selTheta(LogicalOperators::ComparisonOperator::GREATER, 0., ReconstructedParticles));
```

### Sorters

In ral library there are also sorter methods to sort collections based on
a property. For example, we can order particles depending on the value of the 
energy.


```
auto newDf = df.Define("sortByE", "k4::ral::ReconstructedParticle::sortE(ReconstructedParticles));
```

It is also possible to sort in reverse order:

```
auto newDf = df.Define("sortByE", "k4::ral::ReconstructedParticle::sortE(ReconstructedParticles, true));
```

### Reducers

It is possible to combine getters with some VecOps methods in order to reduce
the vectors:

```
auto newDf = df.Define("e", "k4::ral::ReconstructedParticle::getE(ReconstructedParticles))
               .Define("totalE", "ROOT::VecOps::Sum(e));
```
